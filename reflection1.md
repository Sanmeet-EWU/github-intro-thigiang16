# My Reflection on GitHub Basics

## What I Learned:
- Git helps you track changes in your code and save different versions
- I learned how to create a branch to work on separate changes without affecting the main project
- I also learned how to commit changes and open pull requests to share my work with others

## What I'm Confused About:
- I'm still a little unsure about merging branches and what to do when there is a conflict between changes
- Itâ€™s also hard to understand when exactly to use git merge or git pull

## Markdown Experiment:
- **Bold** text for important points.
- *Italic* text for special terms or emphasis.
- I think I need to learn more about merging branches, practice resolving conflicts
